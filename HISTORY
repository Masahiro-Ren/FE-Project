= 2020-10-02 (0.2.0)
* New features
  * Add a library for solving PDEs within regular 3D domains 
    with nodal discontinuous galerkin method (nodal DGM). 
  * Add sample programs of 3D linear advection problems using our library. 
  * Implement a 3D nonhydrostatic atmospheric model with nodal DGM using our library. 
    * Add four test cases for dynamical core: sound wave, inertia gravity wave, density current, and baroclinic wave. 
* Fix many bugs.

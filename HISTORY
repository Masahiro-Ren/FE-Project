* New features
  * Add a library for solving PDEs within 1D and regular 2D domains 
    with nodal discontinuous galerkin method (nodal DGM). 
  * Add sample programs of 1D and 2D linear advection problems using our library. 
  * Implement a 2D nonhydrostatic atmospheric model with nodal DGM using our library. 
    * Add two test cases for dynamical core, gravity wave and density current.

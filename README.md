# FE-project 

## What is FE-project?
FE project provides a library and some sample programs for some discontinuous Galerkin methods 
Futhermore, some dynamical cores of atmospheric and oceanic model with DGM will be provided. 

- Example of simulation results by nonhydrostatic atmospheric models with nodal DGM

 For more animations of simulation results, please see the Wiki of FE-project on github or 'FE-project gallery' channel on YouTube (url: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO17OQtKHwkkQwmHD9y9mQg/featured). 


## Models with FE library
### Nonhydrostatic atmospheric model
- Simple 2D model with only dynamical process
- 3D model with dynamical process and some physical processes


## Simple samples for intrduction to DGM. 
### 1D problems 
  - linear advection equation
    - various profiles of advected quantity
  - linear advection-diffusion equation

### 2D problems 
  - linear advection equation in a rectangle domain
    - various profiles of advected quantity and flow

### 3D problems 
  - linear advection equation in a cubic domain
   - various profiles of advected quantity
  - Euler equation in a cubic domain
    - Test the propagation of sound waves with HEVI temporal methods

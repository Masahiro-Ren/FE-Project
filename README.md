# FE-project 

## What is FE-project?
FE project provides a library and some sample programs for some discontinuous Galerkin methods 
Futhermore, some dynamical cores of atmospheric and oceanic model with DGM will be provided. 

- Example of simulation results by a 2D nonhydrostatic atmospheric model with nodal DGM

 For more animations of simulation results, please see the Wiki of FE-project on github or 'FE-project gallery' channel on YouTube (url: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO17OQtKHwkkQwmHD9y9mQg/featured). 


## Simple samples with FE library
### 1D problems 
  - linear advection 
    - various profiles of advected quantity

### 2D problems 
  - linear advection in a rectangle domain
    - various profiles of advected quantity and flow

### 3D problems 
  - linear advection in a cubic domain
    - various profiles of advected quantity

## Models with FE library
### Dynamical cores of atmospheric model 
- 2-dimensional dynamical core of nonhydrostatic atmospheric model

 
## Build FE library
Please see ``INSTALL.md''.
